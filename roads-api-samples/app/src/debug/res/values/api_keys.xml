    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    WARNING:
    The code supporting this sample has been provided as a single Android app for illustrative
    purposes. In practice you should not distribute your server-side API keys in an Android app as
    your key cannot be secured against unauthorised access from a third party. Instead, to secure
    your keys you should deploy the API-facing code as a server-side proxy and have your Android app
    send requests via the proxy, ensuring requests are authorized.
